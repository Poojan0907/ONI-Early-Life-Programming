## Solution: Inorder Tree Traversal
### Time Complexity: O(n)
### Space Complexity: O(1)
### Input: In the Preorder format and for non existing child use -1;
For exampe tree               5
                            /   \
                           6    10
                         /  \   
                        2    3
                              \
                               9

###Input would be: 5 6 10 2 3 -1 -1 (for child of 10) -1 -1 (child of 2) -1 (left chld of 3) 9 -1 -1 (child of 9)
